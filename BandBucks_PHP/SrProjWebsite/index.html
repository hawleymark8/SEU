	<u><h2> Journal </h2> </u>
			<b>Week of January 18-25:</b>
		<br />
			I created the MySQL database ER Diagram in MySQL Workbench for easy editing and export.  I also updated the Band Bucks database ER Diagram to fix any equipment owner conflicts that would have occurred with the previous model.  Now with two tables (one for user equipment, and the other for band equipment), the owner will be easier to identify and work with in code.  The table displayed on the web application will combine the two equipment tables. I still need to setup a VM to host my database.
			I am currently working on the Login too trying to get the form to interact between javascript and php.
