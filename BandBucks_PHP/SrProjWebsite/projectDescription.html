		<u><h2> Project Description </h2> </u>

		So, you and your friends decided to start a band. Congratulations! <br />
		But how will you keep track of the money!? Afterall, a band is a business... <br />
		<br />
		Introducing Band Bucks to account for your every need!<br />
		Cash, equipment, and debt is all taken care of! 
		<br />
		In the mean time you can jam out rather than waste time asking questions like who owes us money? how much cash are we spending on tour? and how much merchandise is on hand?<br />
		<br />
		Band Bucks will track it all for you!
		
		<h3>Primary Features:</h3>

			<ul>
				<li>Track cash flows!</li>
				<li>Track equipment and merchandise!</li>
				<li>Track who owes what!</li>
				<li>Generate reports for each!</li>				
			</ul>

		<h3>Are you rolling in the dough?</h3>

			<ul>
				<li>Buying/Selling tickets, merchandise, equipment, food, and gas?</li>
				<li>One band member owe another?</li>
				<li>Money split evenly or differently among members?</li>				
			</ul>

			<!-- Within a band, money can be made or lost from selling/buying things such as tickets, merchandise, equipment, or even food and gas.  It is often the case that one band member may owe another money, or the band entity might owe one member their piece of the pie after getting paid from a gig for instance.  Money paid to the band is not always split evenly among the members either, or it may even remain in a band account. --> This is where Band Bucks comes in!  This application makes it easier to account for these transactions accurately and consistently.

		<h3>Cheap and easy accounting!</h3>

			<ul>
				<li>Can't afford an accountant/manager?</li>
				<li>Perfect for new and upcoming bands!</li>
				<li>Free web based application!</li>			
			</ul>

			<!-- Band Bucks is a web based application that can provide cheap and easy accounting bands and their members with band related cash flows. It would be most useful for new and up coming bands because they do not have a large enough income to pay for their own accountant or manager to track their net income/net loss over time. It should also be noted that this application may make the band manager's/accountant's jobs easier if their client uses this service.  -->


			Band bucks would track this cash and even be able to produce reports or statements from it.  This may include, a cash flow statement of cash paid to/from members, or an income statement of how much money the band as a whole has gained or lost within a given time period. 
		<br />

		<h3>What about the gear?</h3>

			<ul>
				<li>Who owns what?</li>
				<li>How much merchandise do you own?</li>
				<li>What is your monetary worth in assets?</li>			
			</ul>

			A band may also want to track the monetary value of their assets such as special show lights, speakers/amplifiers, or instruments.  <!-- Tracking this would be beneficial to produce a balance sheet to display the total monetary worth of a band and its individual members. -->
		<br />
		
		<h3>Band = Business</h3>
		
			<ul>
				<li>Track fiscal success/failure!</li>
				<li>Calendar to track gigs!</li>
				<li>Contacts tab so no one is left behind!</li>			
			</ul>

			Every band is a business, and that is one of the essential lessons to learn in the music industry.  This software would help take the hassle out of it and allow bands to track their success or failure easily while allowing them to focus on their musical creativity.  <!-- Other non-accounting possibilities for this program might include a calendar tab to track gigs, or a contacts tab to keep track of promoters and booking agents that have worked with the band before. -->
